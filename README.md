# Stevens Programming <br>
This is my personal website to explain a little bit about myself and also list my projects and ones I have contributed to. Also, on this site I have set up a blog to write about what I am currently learning. <br><br><br>

## Technology <br>
This site is created using Angular and Material 2. I have also used the GitHub API to create the GitHub sections. For the blog I set up WordPress on the backend to render the content in Angular.
