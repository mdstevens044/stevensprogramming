# Stevens Programming <br>
This is my personal website to explain a little bit about myself and also list my projects and ones I have contributed to. Also, on this site I have set up a blog to write about what I am currently learning. <br><br>

## Technology <br> 
This site is created using Angular 9. I have also used the GitHub API to create the GitHub section. For the blog I set up ButterCMS and used their API.
